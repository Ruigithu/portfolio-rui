              <p>Hi, I’m Rui Peng! In this blog, I’d like to share a bit about myself. </p>
              <hr>
              <p>
                Soon, I’ll graduate with a master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Two years ago, as an ambitious undergraduate dreaming of a journalism career, I couldn't have imagined pursuing software development instead.  </p>
              <p>
                I left journalism because it felt like a cage—rules dictated every word, stifling my potential. 
                I craved a path with room to grow, where I could test my limits and break free from constant pressure to conform. 
                Back then, the relentless voices of tradition and expectation—telling me who to be, how to act—drained my energy. 
                I needed an escape, not just from the job, but from that mindset. </p>
              <p>
                Programming started as my way out, a tool to redefine my future. 
                Unlike writing articles, coding was alien. 
                With no computer science background or mentor, I doubted myself often. 
                I’d heard programmers groan about debugging, but spending a whole day configuring an environment? 
                That hit differently. 
                Still, my drive to carve my own path pushed me past the fear. 
                I moved from <code>System.out.println("Hello World!");</code> to building two web applications from scratch.
              </p>
              <p>Just 20 days ago, I wasn’t convinced I could be a software engineer. 
                Technical interviews and complex problems felt daunting, exposing gaps I feared I couldn’t bridge. 
                But I paused, refocused, and leaned into what I’d already learned. 
                Optimizing my applications’ performance showed me I might just pull this off.   
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m a mix of dreamer and doer. 
                I want skills that unlock new possibilities, rooted in what I love and believe in. 
                Passion fuels persistence, I’ve learned. 
                At first, coding didn’t feel like mine—I was a journalist, wired for stories, not logic. 
                Effort, not instinct, got me here. Then, last week, a Jungian cognitive test surprised me: I’m driven by “Ti” (introverted thinking), thriving on analysis. 
                Skeptical, I retook it twice—same result.
              </p>

              <p>
                Curious, I asked ChatGPT about it. 
                It wasn’t shocked—my technical questions had already hinted at a developer’s mind. 
                But looking back, my shift to coding wasn’t random; it’s the result of persistence, curiosity, and a hunger for something bigger. 
                Now, I believe I can make it.
